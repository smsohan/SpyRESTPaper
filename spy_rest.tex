% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

Documentation of RESTful APIs are expensive to produce and maintain. It is expensive because there is a lack of reusable tools and automated solutions for RESTful API documentation. Most RESTful APIs are documented manually and the API developers are responsible for keeping an updated documentation as the API evolves making the process both costly and error-prone. In this paper we introduce SpyREST, a reusable tool that can automatically generate RESTful API documentation. SpyREST uses a proxy to intercept example API calls and intelligently produces API documentation for RESTful Web APIs by processing the request and response data. Using SpyREST, RESTful API developers can significantly reduce the cost of producing and maintaining API documentation by replacing a large part of the manual process of documentation with an automated one.

% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on

\section{Introduction}
RESTful APIs are used as a primary interconnection mechanism among modern day Web based systems. For example, the website of a restaurant can use the RESTful API from Twitter to show the latest tweets mentioning the restaurant so that prospective customers can read the experience shared by others. To allow others to use their APIs, Twitter and other RESTful API developers publish documentation describing different features of their RESTful API. The documentation of such RESTful APIs are commonly produced and maintained using a manual process.

API documentation for library APIs, such as Java Standard Edition, commonly leverage reusable tools such as JavaDoc. The documentation produced by such tools include description of objects and methods, with custom texts primarily sourced via comments. On the other hand, RESTful APIs documentation includes additional information such as HTTP headers, request parameters, request and response data in serialized formats such as JSON, XML that cannot be easily derived from looking at the objects and methods in the source code. Using comments for these additional information also requires significant manual effort because there is a lack of reusable tools to automate the documentation process. This makes the task of RESTful API documentation a costly and error-prone one. In addition to producing the API documentation, API developers also need to publish and often maintain the documentation for multiple versions as the RESTful API evolves. This requires further manual effort because it becomes a continuous process.

To produce RESTful API documentation with information about HTTP headers, URL parameters, request and response data, the manual process is driven by example API calls. Example calls are made and recorded against an API endpoint to gather information for documentation. This process can be described as a six-step process as follows: 1) craft an example call to an API endpoint with required headers, URL parameters and request body, 2) make the call, 3) capture the response headers and data, 4) strip any unwanted data from the captured information, 5) add custom descriptions to the captured data and 6) publish the API documentation. This six-step process is essentially repeated for all API endpoints that are documented.

With SpyREST, we have implemented an innovative solution to largely automate the aforementioned manual process of RESTful API documentation so that all but steps 1 and 5 are automated. Steps 1 and 5 are left to a manual process to allow for a pragmatic solution that leverages computers to automate the repeated part of the process while leaving the rest to humans. Our solution relies on a lightweight HTTP proxy server to intercept example API calls so that all the information about HTTP headers, URL parameters, request and response data can be automatically gathered. The collected data is then processed to present the documentation for RESTful resources under a hierarchy defined by API versions, resources and actions. Sensitive data such as authentication tokens and passwords are automatically filtered and are not captured. Because SpyREST uses a HTTP proxy server, it can generate documentation for all RESTful APIs irrespective of the technology used to implement the API. The resultant is an automated yet customizable, version-aware, collaboration enabled and reusable API documentation software as a service platform that can be used to generate and maintain documentation for any RESTful API.

The implication of SpyREST is two-fold. It helps lower the cost of producing and maintaining RESTful API documentation through automation and provides a shared platform for publishing the documentation of different RESTful APIs.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section we provide background information on the topic of RESTful API and API documentation. Then, we discuss the related work in the following section. The implementation details of SpyREST is provided next. Then, we discuss the implications and limitations of our work in the discussion section. We present our core contributions and future work in the conclusion.


\section{Related Work} % (fold)
\label{sec:related_work}
Several papers have been published on areas related to RESTful API documentation that are discussed under the following two categories: RESTful API documentation and general API learnability.

\subsection{RESTful API Documentation} % (fold)
\label{sub:restful_api_documentation}

To address the need for a standard format to describe RESTful APIs several related works proposed candidate specifications. For example, Danielsen et al. presented at vocabulary for documenting RESTful Web APIs called Web Interface Language (WIfL) \cite{Danielsen_validation}. The vocabulary comprises of these following objects, Resource, Request, Response, Representation and Parameters that can describe the structure and example usage of RESTful Web APIs. Generation of WIfL specific objects for RESTful APIs requires manual effort or bespoke implementation since a reusable automated approach is not presented. With SpyREST, we focus on automation so that reusable tools can be used to produce RESTful API documentation.

Verborgh et at. presented RESTdesc, a Resource oriented and Hyper-link based specification for describing RESTful APIs \cite{Verborgh_functional}. RESTdesc relies on pre and postconditions to describe the outcome of an API call so that a general purpose API client can parse RESTdesc formatted documentation to invoke API calls to specific RESTful APIs. Mangler et al. presented RDDL, a XML based specification for describing RESTful APIs \cite{Mangler_rddl}. RDDL descriptions are composed of resources, operations, parameters and headers. Manual effort is needed to generate RESTdesc and RDDL formatted documentations.

Kopecky´ et al. presented hRESTS, a machine readable micro-format to describe RESTful APIs that uses an alternate representation compared to WIfL \cite{Kopecky_hrests}. hRESTS specification comprises of Service, Operation, Address, Method, Input, Output and Label objects to describe RESTful APIs. Automated XML transformation is used to convert a formatted HTML documentation of a RESTful API into hRESTS so that the machine readable format can be used by RESTful API clients for automated invocation. SpyREST aims to minimize the cost of a manual or custom process to generate and maintain formatted HTML documentation by leveraging an automated approach.

Maleshkova et al. presented OmniVoke, a RESTful API based invocation engine that provides an abstraction layer for RESTful API calls to multiple APIs that follow different conventions \cite{Maleshkova_omnivoke}. A general purpose RESTful API client can be used against OmniVoke since the different conventions are wrapped under a uniform RESTful API.

Myers et al. performed a user study based on the documentation of Web APIs used in large scale enterprises to understand the desirable contents for Web API documentation \cite{Myers_study}. They recommended providing a consistent look-and-feel with explanation for the starting points and an overall map comprising of both text and diagrams, providing a browsing experience with breadcrumb trail following a hierarchy, an effective search interface, providing example code and a way to exercise the examples online without writing code. SpyREST aims to achieve these desired contents and organization for RESTful APIs using an automated and customizable approach that can be reused across different RESTful APIs.

In addition to the research community, there are several RESTful API specification formats that are observed in the industry. Swagger is a JSON based specification that allows users to describe RESTful APIs in terms of paths, parameters, request and response headers and bodies \footnote{https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md}. RAML is a RESTful API documentation format that uses YAML files to describe RESTful API documentation using a similar hierarchy as Swagger \footnote{http://raml.org/spec.html}. Blueprint is another RESTful API specification format that uses Markdown files with additional tags to describe RESTful API objects \footnote{https://github.com/apiaryio/api-blueprint}. In addition to producing RESTful API documentation, there are tools and software as a service (SaaS) providers that can be used to publish the documentation and auto generate API client code for RESTful APIs that are described using one of these formats. The key limitation of these tools is a manual process that is required to create and maintain the documentations for these formats since there is a lack of automated approaches to do so.

% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.
